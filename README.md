# (I) Abstract : 

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. The efficient market hypothesis posits that stock prices are a function of information and rational expectations, and that newly revealed information about a company's prospects is almost immediately reflected in the current stock price. Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction â€“ physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. 

In this endeavor we will work with historical data about the stock prices of few publicly listed companies and implement machine learning based on **Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)** to predict the future stock prices. 

# (II) Dataset Used : 

The dataset was made publically available on *Kaggle* platform. The Google's stock prices were taken from *SuperDataScience* webpage. 
* **AMD** : **https://www.kaggle.com/gunhee/amdgoogle**
* **Tesla** : **https://www.kaggle.com/rpaguirre/tesla-stock-price**

The others have been uploaded in their respective subfolder for easy access.
