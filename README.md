# (I) Abstract : 

Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield significant profit. The efficient market hypothesis posits that stock prices are a function of information and rational expectations, and that newly revealed information about a company's prospects is almost immediately reflected in the current stock price. Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. 

In this endeavor we will work with historical data about the stock prices of few publicly listed companies and implement machine learning based on **Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)** to predict the future stock prices. 

# (II) Dataset Used : 

The dataset was made publically available on *Kaggle* platform. The Google's stock prices were taken from *SuperDataScience* webpage. 
* **AMD** : **https://www.kaggle.com/gunhee/amdgoogle**
* **Tesla** : **https://www.kaggle.com/rpaguirre/tesla-stock-price**

The others have been uploaded in their respective subfolder for easy access.

# (III) Libraries Used : 

## Numpy : 

Fundamental package for scientific computing in Python3, helping us in creating and managing n-dimensional tensors. A vector can be regarded as a 1-D tensor, matrix as 2-D, and so on.

## Pandas : 

Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series.

## Matplotlib : 

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

## Seaborn : 

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. 

## Tensorflow's Keras API

Is an open source deep learning framework for dataflow and differentiable programming. It’s created and maintained by Google.
